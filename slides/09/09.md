# Structured Prediction

Consider generating a sequence of $y_1, \ldots, y_N ∈ Y^N$ given input
$→x_1, \ldots, →x_N$.

~~~
Predicting each sequence element independently models the distribution $P(y_i | ⇉X)$.

![w=40%,h=center](labeling_independent.svgz)

~~~
However, there may be dependencies among the $y_i$ themselves, which
is difficult to capture by independent element classification.

---
# Maximum Entropy Markov Models

We might model the dependencies by assuming that the output sequence is
a Markov chain, and model it as
$$P(y_i | ⇉X, y_{i-1}).$$

~~~
Each label would be predicted by a softmax from the hidden state and _the
previous label_.
![w=40%,h=center](labeling_memm.svgz)

~~~
The decoding can be then performed by a dynamic programming algorithm.

---
# Maximum Entropy Markov Models

However, MEMMs suffer from a so-called _label bias_ problem. Because the
probability is factorized, each $P(y_i | ⇉X, y_{i-1})$ is a distribution
and **must sum to one**.

~~~
Imagine there was a label error during prediction. In the next step, the model
might “realize” that the previous label has very low probability of being
followed by any label – however, it cannot express this by setting the
probability of all following labels low, it has to “conserve the mass”.

---
# Conditional Random Fields

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph such that $→y$ is indexed by vertices of $G$.
Then $(⇉X, →y)$ is a **conditional random field**, if the random variables $→y$
conditioned on $⇉X$ obey the Markov property with respect to the graph, i.e.,
$$P(y_i | ⇉X, y_j, i ≠j) = P(y_i | ⇉X, y_j ~ ∀j: (i, j) ∈ E).$$

~~~
By a _fundamental theorem of random fields_, the density of a conditional random
field can be factorized over the cliques of the graph $G$:
$$P(→y | ⇉X) = ∏_{\textrm{clique~}C\textrm{~of~}G} P(→y_C|⇉X).$$

---
# Linear-Chain Conditional Random Fields (CRF)

Usually often assume that dependencies of $→y$, conditioned on $⇉X$, form a chain.

![w=40%,h=center](labeling_crf.svgz)

~~~
Then, the cliques are _nodes_ and _edges_, and we usually factorize the
probability as:
$$P(→y | ⇉X) ∝ \exp\Big(∑_{i=1}^N \log P(y_i | →x_i) + ∑_{i=2}^N \log P(y_i, y_{i-1})\Big).$$

---
# Linear-Chain Conditional Random Fields (CRF)

Linear-chain Conditional Random Field, usually abbreviated only to CRF, acts as
an output layer. It can be considered an extension of softmax – instead of
a sequence of independent softmaxes, it is a sentence-level softmax, with
additional weights for neighboring sequence elements.

We start by defining a score of a label sequence $→y$ as
$$s(⇉X, →y; →θ, ⇉A) = ∑\nolimits_{i=1}^N \big(⇉A_{y_{i-1}, y_i} + f_→θ(y_i | ⇉X)\big)$$
~~~
and define the probability of a label sequence $→y$ using $\softmax$:
$$p(→y | ⇉X) = \softmax_{→z ∈ Y^N}\big(s(⇉X, →z)\big)_{→y}.$$

~~~
For cross-entropy (and also to avoid underflow), we need a logarithm of the probability:
$$\begin{gathered}
  \log p(→y | ⇉X) = s(⇉X, →y) - \operatorname{logsumexp}_{→z ∈ Y^N}\big(s(⇉X, →z)\big),~\textrm{where} \\
  \textstyle\operatorname{logsumexp}_x\big(f(x)\big) = \log(∑\nolimits_x e^{f(x)}).
\end{gathered}$$

---
# Linear-Chain Conditional Random Fields (CRF)

## Computation

We can compute $p(→y | ⇉X)$ efficiently using dynamic programming. We denote
$α_t(k)$ the logarithmic probability of all $t$-element sequences with the
last label $y$ being $k$.

~~~
The core idea is the following:

![w=40%,h=center](crf_composability.svgz)

$$α_t(k) = f_→θ(y_t=k | ⇉X) + \operatorname{logsumexp}_{j∈Y} (α_{t-1}(j) + ⇉A_{j, k}).$$

~~~
For efficient implementation, we use the fact that
$$\begin{gathered}
  \ln(a+b) = \ln a + \ln (1 + e^{\ln b - \ln a}),~\textrm{so} \\
  \textstyle\operatorname{logsumexp}_x\big(f(x)\big) = \max_x\big(f(x)\big) + \log(∑\nolimits_x e^{f(x) - \max_x(f(x))}).
\end{gathered}$$

# Conditional Random Fields (CRF)

## Decoding

We can perform decoding optimally, by using the same algorithm, only replacing
$\operatorname{logsumexp}$ with $\max$ and tracking where the maximum was attained.

~~~
## Applications

![w=65%,f=right](../08/cle_rnn_gru.png)

The CRF output layer is useful for _span labeling_ tasks, like
- named entity recognition,
- dialog slot filling.

It can be also useful for image segmentation.

section: CTC
# Connectionist Temporal Classification

Let us again consider generating a sequence of $y_1, \ldots, y_M$ given input
$→x_1, \ldots, →x_N$, but this time $M ≤ N$ and there is no explicit alignment
of $→x$ and $y$ in the gold data.

~~~
![w=100%,mh=90%,v=middle](ctc_example.svgz)

---
# Connectionist Temporal Classification

We enlarge the set of output labels by a – (_blank_) and perform a classification for every
input element to produce an _extended labeling_. We then post-process it by the
following rules (denoted as $𝓑$):
1. We collapse multiple neighboring occurrences of the same symbol into one.
2. We remove the blank –.

~~~
Because the explicit alignment of inputs and labels is not known, we consider
_all possible_ alignments.

~~~
Denoting the probability of label $l$ at time $t$ as $p_l^t$, we define
$$α^t(s) ≝ ∑_{\substack{\textrm{extended}\\\textrm{labelings~}→π:\\𝓑(→π_{1:t}) = →y_{1:s}}} ∏_{t'=1}^t p_{→π_{t'}}^{t'}.$$

---
# CRF and CTC Comparison

In CRF, we normalize the whole sentences, therefore we need to compute
unnormalized probabilities for all the (exponentially many) sentences. Decoding
can be performed optimally.

~~~
In CTC, we normalize per each label. However, because we do not have explicit
alignment, we compute probability of a labeling by summing probabilities
of (generally exponentially many) extended labelings.

---
# Connectionist Temporal Classification

## Computation

When aligning an extended labeling to a regular one, we need to consider
whether the extended labeling ends by a _blank_ or not. We therefore define
$$\begin{aligned}
  α_-^t(s) &≝ ∑_{\substack{\textrm{extended}\\\textrm{labelings~}→π:\\𝓑(→π_{1:t}) = →y_{1:s}, π_t=-}} ∏_{t'=1}^t p_{→π_{t'}}^{t'} \\
  α_*^t(s) &≝ ∑_{\substack{\textrm{extended}\\\textrm{labelings~}→π:\\𝓑(→π_{1:t}) = →y_{1:s}, π_t≠-}} ∏_{t'=1}^t p_{→π_{t'}}^{t'}

\end{aligned}$$
and compute $α^t(s)$ as $α_-^t(s) + α_*^t(s)$.

---
# Connectionist Temporal Classification

## Computation – Initialization

![w=35%,f=right](ctc_computation.svgz)

We initialize $α$s as follows:
- $α_-^1(0) ← p_-^1$
- $α_*^1(1) ← p_{y_1}^1$

~~~
## Computation – Induction Step

We then proceed recurrently according to:
- $α_-^t(s) ← p_-^t \big(α_*^{t-1}(s) + α_-^{t-1}(s)\big)$
~~~
- $α_*^t(s) ← \begin{cases}
  p_{y_s}^t\big(α_*^{t-1}(s) + α_-^{t-1}(s-1) + α_*^{t-1}(s-1)\big)\textrm{, if }y_s≠y_{s-1}\\
  p_{y_s}^t\big(α_*^{t-1}(s) + α_-^{t-1}(s-1)\big)\textrm{, if }y_s=y_{s-1}\\
\end{cases}$

section: CTCDecoding
# CTC Decoding

Unlike CRF, we cannot perform the decoding optimally.

~~~
The key
observation is that while an optimal extended labeling can be extended
into an optimal labeling of a larger length, the same does not apply to
regular (non-extended) labeling. The problem is that regular labeling corresponds
to many extended labelings, which are modified each in a different way
during an extension of the regular labeling.

~~~
![w=75%,h=center](ctc_decoding.svgz)

# CTC Decoding

## Beam Search

~~~
To perform beam search, we keep $k$ best **regular** (non-extended) labelings.
Specifically, for each regular labeling $→y$ we keep both $α^t_-(→y)$ and
$α^t_*(→y)$, which are probabilities of all (modulo beam search) extended
labelings of length $t$ which produce the regular labeling $→y$; we therefore
keep $k$ regular labelings with highest $α^t_-(→y) + α^t_*(→y)$.

~~~
To compute the best regular labelings for longer prefix of extended labelings,
for each regular labeling in the beam we consider the following cases:
~~~
- adding a _blank_ symbol, i.e., contributing to $α^{t+1}_-(→y)$ both from
  $α^t_-(→y)$ and $α^t_*(→y)$;
~~~
- adding a non-blank symbol, i.e., contributing to $α^{t+1}_*(→⋅)$ from
  $α^t_-(→y)$ and to possibly different $α^{t+1}_*(→⋅)$ from $α^t_*(→y)$.

~~~
Finally, we merge the resulting candidates according to their regular labeling and
keep only the $k$ best.

section: Word2Vec
# Unsupervised Word Embeddings

The embeddings can be trained for each task separately.

~~~

However, a method of precomputing word embeddings have been proposed, based on
_distributional hypothesis_:

> **Words that are used in the same contexts tend to have similar meanings**.

~~~
The distributional hypothesis is usually attributed to Firth (1957):
> _You shall know a word by a company it keeps._

# Word2Vec

word embeddings, together with a C multi-threaded implementation `word2vec`.

# Word2Vec – SkipGram Model

![w=55%,h=center,mh=70%](word2vec.svgz)

Considering input word $w_i$ and output $w_o$, the Skip-gram model defines
$$p(w_o | w_i) ≝ \frac{e^{⇉W_{w_o}^\top ⇉V_{w_i}}}{∑_w e^{⇉W_w^\top ⇉V_{w_i}}}.$$

---
# Word2Vec – Hierarchical Softmax

Instead of a large softmax, we construct a binary tree over the words, with
a sigmoid classifier for each node.

If word $w$ corresponds to a path $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_L$, we define
$$p_\textrm{HS}(w | w_i) ≝ ∏_{j=1}^{L-1} σ(\textrm{[+1 if }n_{j+1}\textrm{  is right child else -1]} \cdot ⇉W_{n_j}^\top ⇉V_{w_i}).$$

---
# Word2Vec – Negative Sampling

Instead of a large softmax, we could train individual sigmoids for all words.

We could also only sample the _negative examples_ instead of training all of
them.

This gives rise to the following _negative sampling_ objective:
$$l_\textrm{NEG}(w_o, w_i) ≝ \log σ(⇉W_{w_o}^\top ⇉V_{w_i}) + ∑_{j=1}^k 𝔼_{w_j ∼ P(w)} \log \big(1 - σ(⇉W_{w_j}^\top ⇉V_{w_i})\big).$$

~~~
The usual value of negative samples $k$ is 5, but it can be even 2 for extremely
large corpora.

~~~

For $P(w)$, both uniform and unigram distribution $U(w)$ work, but
$$U(w)^{3/4}$$
outperforms them significantly (this fact has been reported in several papers by
different authors).

# Character N-grams

Another simple idea appeared simultaneously in three nearly simultaneous
publications as [Charagram](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02789), [Subword Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04606) or [SubGram](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-45510-5_21).

A word embedding is a sum of the word embedding plus embeddings of its character
_n_-grams. Such embedding can be pretrained using same algorithms as `word2vec`.

~~~
The implementation can be
- dictionary based: only some number of frequent character _n_-grams is kept;
~~~
- hash-based: character _n_-grams are hashed into $K$ buckets
  (usually $K ∼ 10^6$ is used).
