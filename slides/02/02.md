# Refresh – Neural Networks

- Neural network describes a computation, which gets an input tensor and
  produces an output.

~~~
  - For the time being, the input tensor has a fixed size.
~~~
  - The input tensor is usually a vector, but it can be 2D/3D/4D tensor.
    - images, video, time sequences like speech, …
~~~
  - The output usually describes a distribution.
    - normal distribution for regression
    - Bernoulli for binary classification
    - categorical for multiclass classification

~~~
- The basic units are **nodes**, composed in an acyclic graph.

~~~
- The edges have weights, nodes have activation functions.

~~~
- Nodes of neural networks are usually composed in layers.

# Machine Learning Basics

We usually have a **training set**, which is assumed to consist of examples
generated independently from a **data-generating distribution**.

~~~
The goal of _optimization_ is to match the training set as well as possible.

~~~
However, the goal of _machine learning_ is to perform well on _previously
unseen_ data, to achieve lowest **generalization error** or **test error**. We
typically estimate it using a **test set** of examples independent of the
training set, but generated by the same data-generating distribution.

~~~
The **No free lunch theorem** (Wolpert, 1996) states that averaging over
_all possible_ data distributions, every classification algorithm achieves
the same _overall_ error when processing unseen examples. In a sense, no machine
learning algorithm is _universally_ better than others.

# Machine Learning Basics

Challenges in machine learning:
- _underfitting_ (the model is “too weak”, bad performance even on training set)
- _overfitting_ (the model is “too strong”, learned rules are too specific and do
  not generalize)
![w=83%,h=center](underfitting_overfitting.svgz)

---
# Machine Learning Basics

We can control whether a model underfits or overfits by modifying its _capacity_.
~~~
- _representational capacity_ (what the model could represent, depends on the
  model size)

~~~
- _effective capacity_ (what the model actually learns, depends on training,
  regularization, …)

~~~
![w=81%,h=center](generalization_error.svgz)

# Machine Learning Basics

Any change in a machine learning algorithm that is designed to _reduce
generalization error_ (but not necessarily its training error) is called
**regularization**.

~~~

**$L^2$ regularization** (also called **weight decay**) penalizes models
with large weights (using a penalty of $\frac{1}{2}\|→θ\|^2$).

![w=70%,h=center](regularization.svgz)

---
# Machine Learning Basics

**Hyperparameters** are not adapted by a learning algorithm itself,
while the model **parameters** (weights, biases) are adapted by it.

~~~
Usually a **development set**, also called a **validation set**, is used to
estimate the generalization error, allowing to update hyperparameters accordingly.

section: MLE
# Loss Function

A model is usually trained in order to minimize the **loss** on the training data.

~~~

Assuming that a model computes $f(→x;→θ)$ using parameters $→θ$,
the **mean square error** of given $N$ examples $\big(→x^{(1)}, y^{(1)}\big),
\big(→x^{(2)}, y^{(2)}\big), …, \big(→x^{(N)}, y^{(N)}\big)$ is computed as
$$\frac{1}{N} ∑_{i=1}^N \Big(f(→x^{(i)}; →θ) - y^{(i)}\Big)^2.$$

~~~
A common principle used to design loss functions is the **maximum likelihood
principle**.

---
# Maximum Likelihood Estimation

Let $𝕏 = \{→x^{(1)}, →x^{(2)}, …, →x^{(N)}\}$ be training data drawn
independently from the data-generating distribution $p_\textrm{data}$.

~~~
We denote the **empirical data distribution** as $p̂_\textrm{data}$, where
$$p̂_\textrm{data}(→x) ≝ \frac{\big|\{i: →x^{(i)} = →x\}\big|}{N}.$$

~~~
Let $p_\textrm{model}(⁇→x; →θ)$ be a family of distributions.
~~~
- If the weights are fixed, $p_\textrm{model}(⁇→x{\color{lightgray}; →θ})$ is a probability distribution.
~~~
- If we instead consider the fixed training data $𝕏$, then
  $$L(→θ) = p_\textrm{model}(𝕏; →θ) = ∏\nolimits_{i=1}^N p_\textrm{model}(→x^{(i)}; →θ)$$
  is called the **likelihood**.
~~~
  Note that even if the value of the likelihood is in range $[0, 1]$, it is not
  a probability, because the likelihood is not a probability distribution.

# Maximum Likelihood Estimation

Let $𝕏 = \{→x^{(1)}, →x^{(2)}, …, →x^{(N)}\}$ be training data drawn
independently from the data-generating distribution $p_\textrm{data}$. We denote
the empirical data distribution as $p̂_\textrm{data}$ and let
$p_\textrm{model}(⁇→x; →θ)$ be a family of distributions.

The **maximum likelihood estimation** of $→θ$ is:

$\displaystyle \kern8em\mathllap{→θ_\mathrm{MLE}} = \argmax_{→θ} p_\textrm{model}(𝕏; →θ) = \argmax_{→θ} ∏\nolimits_{i=1}^N p_\textrm{model}(→x^{(i)}; →θ)$

~~~
$\displaystyle \kern8em{} = \argmin_{→θ} ∑\nolimits_{i=1}^N -\log p_\textrm{model}(→x^{(i)}; →θ)$

~~~
$\displaystyle \kern8em{} = \argmin_{→θ} 𝔼_{⁇→x ∼ p̂_\textrm{data}} [-\log p_\textrm{model}(→x; →θ)]$

# Maximum Likelihood Estimation

MLE can be easily generalized to the conditional case, where our goal is to predict $y$ given $→x$:

~~~
$$\begin{aligned}
→θ_\mathrm{MLE} &= \argmax_{→θ} p_\textrm{model}(𝕐 | 𝕏; →θ) = \argmin_{→θ} ∑\nolimits_{i=1}^N -\log p_\textrm{model}(y^{(i)} | →x^{(i)}; →θ) \\
                &= \argmin_{→θ} ∑\nolimits_{i=1}^N -\log p_\textrm{model}(y^{(i)} | →x^{(i)}; →θ) \\
                &= \argmin_{→θ} 𝔼_{(⁇→x, ⁇y) ∼ p̂_\textrm{data}} [-\log p_\textrm{model}(y | →x; →θ)] \\
                &= \argmin_{→θ} H(p̂_\textrm{data}(⁇y | ⁇→x), p_\textrm{model}(⁇y | ⁇→x; →θ)) \\
                &= \argmin_{→θ} D_\textrm{KL}(p̂_\textrm{data}(⁇y | ⁇→x)\|p_\textrm{model}(⁇y | ⁇→x; →θ)) \color{gray} + H(p̂_\textrm{data}(⁇y | ⁇→x))
\end{aligned}$$

~~~
where the conditional entropy is defined as
$H(p̂_\textrm{data}) = 𝔼_{(⁇→x, ⁇y) ∼ p̂_\textrm{data}} [-\log (p̂_\textrm{data}(y | →x; →θ))]$
and the conditional cross-entropy as
$H(p̂_\textrm{data}, p_\textrm{model}) = 𝔼_{(⁇→x, ⁇y) ∼ p̂_\textrm{data}} [-\log (p_\textrm{model}(y | →x; →θ))]$.

~~~
The resulting _loss function_ is called **negative log-likelihood** (**NLL**), or
**cross-entropy**, or **Kullback-Leibler divergence**.

# Estimators and Bias

An **estimator** is a rule for computing an estimate of a given value, often an
expectation of some random value(s).
For example, we might estimate _mean_ of a random variable by sampling a value
according to its probability distribution.

~~~
The **bias** of an estimator is the difference of the expected value of the estimator
and the true value being estimated.
~~~
If the bias is zero, we call the estimator **unbiased**, otherwise **biased**.

~~~
If we have a sequence of estimates, it might also happen that the bias converges
to zero. Consider the well-known sample estimate of variance. Given independent
and identically distributed random variables $⁇x_1, \ldots, ⁇x_N$, we might
estimate the mean and the variance as
$$μ̂ = \frac{1}{N} ∑\nolimits_i x_i,~~~σ̂^2 = \frac{1}{N} ∑\nolimits_i (x_i - μ̂)^2.$$
~~~
Such a mean estimate is unbiased, but the estimate of the variance is biased,
because $𝔼[σ̂^2] = (1 - \frac{1}{N})σ^2$; however, the bias of this estimate
converges to zero for increasing $N$.

~~~
Also, an unbiased estimator does not necessarily have a small variance – in some
cases, it can have a large variance, so a biased estimator with a smaller variance
might be preferred.

# Properties of Maximum Likelihood Estimation

Assume that the true data-generating distribution $p_\textrm{data}$ lies within the model
family $p_\textrm{model}(•; →θ)$, and assume there exists a unique
$→θ_{p_\textrm{data}}$ such that $p_\textrm{data} = p_\textrm{model}(•; →θ_{p_\textrm{data}})$.

~~~
- MLE is a _consistent_ estimator. If we denote $→θ_m$ to be the parameters
  found by MLE for a training set with $m$ examples generated by the
  data-generating distribution, then $→θ_m$ converges in probability to
  $→θ_{p_\textrm{data}}$.

  Formally, for any $ε > 0$, $P(\|→θ_m - →θ_{p_\textrm{data}}\| > ε) → 0$
  as $m → ∞$.

~~~
- MLE is in a sense the _most statistically efficient_. For any consistent estimator,
  let us consider the average distance of $→θ_m$ and $→θ_{p_\textrm{data}}$:
  $𝔼_{⁇→x_1, …, ⁇→x_m ∼ p_\textrm{data}} \big[\|→θ_m - →θ_{p_\textrm{data}}\|^2\big]$. \
  It can be shown (Rao 1945, Cramér 1946) that no consistent estimator has
  lower mean squared error than the maximum likelihood estimator.

~~~
Therefore, for reasons of consistency and efficiency, maximum likelihood is
often considered the preferred estimator for machine learning.

# Mean Square Error as MLE

During regression, we predict a number, not a real probability distribution.
In order to generate a distribution, we might consider a distribution with
the mean of the predicted value and a fixed variance $σ^2$ – the most general
such a distribution is the normal distribution.

![w=50%,h=center](constant_variance.svgz)

---
# Mean Square Error as MLE

Let $f(→x; →θ)$ be the output of our model, which we assume to be the mean of $y$.

~~~
We define $p(y | →x)$ as $𝓝(y; f(→x; →θ), σ^2)$ for some fixed $σ^2$.
~~~
The MLE then results in

![w=18%,f=right;position:absolute;right:.5em](normal_paranormal.png)

$\displaystyle \kern8em\mathllap{\argmax_{→θ} p(𝕐 | 𝕏; →θ)} = \argmin_{→θ} ∑_{i=1}^N -\log p(y^{(i)} | →x^{(i)} ; →θ)$

~~~
$\displaystyle \kern1.5em{} = \argmin_{→θ} -∑_{i=1}^N \log \sqrt{\frac{1}{2πσ^2}} e ^ {\normalsize -\frac{(y^{(i)} - f(→x^{(i)}; →θ))^2}{2σ^2}}$

~~~
$\displaystyle \kern1.5em{} = \argmin_{→θ} {\color{gray} -N \log (2πσ^2)^{-1/2}} - ∑_{i=1}^N -\frac{\big(y^{(i)} - f(→x^{(i)}; →θ)\big)^2}{2σ^2}$

~~~
$\displaystyle \kern1.5em{} = \argmin_{→θ} ∑_{i=1}^N \frac{\big(y^{(i)} - f(→x^{(i)}; →θ)\big)^2}{2σ^2} = \argmin_{→θ} \frac{1}{N} ∑_{i=1}^N \big(f(→x^{(i)}; →θ) - y^{(i)}\big)^2.$

section: Gradient Descent
# Gradient Descent

Let a model compute $f(→x;→θ)$ using parameters $→θ$, and for a given loss
function $L$ denote
$$E(→θ) = 𝔼_{(⁇→x, ⁇y)∼p̂_\textrm{data}} L\big(f(→x; →θ), y\big).$$
~~~
![w=53%,f=right](gradient_descent.svgz)

Assuming we are minimizing an error function
$$\argmin_{→θ} E(→θ),$$
we may use _gradient descent_:
$$→θ ← →θ - α ∇_{→θ} E(→θ).$$

~~~
The constant $α$ is called a **learning rate** and specifies the “length”
of a step we perform in every iteration of the gradient descent.

---
# Gradient Descent Variants

The gradient of the error function $E(→θ)$ can be computed as
$$∇_{→θ} E(→θ) = 𝔼_{(⁇→x, ⁇y)∼p̂_\textrm{data}} ∇_{→θ} L\big(f(→x; →θ), y\big).$$

~~~
- **(Standard/Batch) Gradient Descent**: We use all training data to compute $∇_{→θ} E(→θ)$.

~~~
- **Stochastic (or Online) Gradient Descent**: We estimate $∇_{→θ} E(→θ)$ using
  a single random example from the training data. Such an estimate is unbiased,
  but very noisy.

$$∇_{→θ} E(→θ) ≈ ∇_{→θ} L\big(f(→x; →θ), y\big)\textrm{~~for a randomly chosen~~}(→x, y)\textrm{~~from~~}p̂_\textrm{data}.$$

~~~
- **Minibatch SGD**: Trade-off between gradient descent and SGD – the
  expectation in $∇_{→θ} E(→θ)$ is estimated using $m$ random independent
  examples from the training data.

$$∇_{→θ} E(→θ) ≈ \frac{1}{m} ∑_{i=1}^m ∇_{→θ} L\big(f(→x^{(i)}; →θ), y^{(i)}\big)
  \textrm{~~for randomly chosen~~}(→x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})\textrm{~~from~~}p̂_\textrm{data}.$$

---
# Stochastic Gradient Descent Convergence

Assume that we perform a stochastic gradient descent, using a sequence
of learning rates $α_i$, and using a noisy estimate $J(→θ)$ of the real
gradient $∇_{→θ} E(→θ)$:
$$→θ_{i+1} ← →θ_i - α_i J(→θ_i).$$

~~~
It can be proven (under some reasonable conditions; see Robbins and Monro
algorithm, 1951) that if the loss function is convex and continuous, then SGD
converges to the unique optimum almost surely if the sequence of learning rates
$α_i$ fulfills the following conditions:
$$∑_i α_i = ∞,~~~∑_i α_i^2 < ∞.$$

~~~
Note that the second condition implies that $α_i → 0$.

~~~
For nonconvex loss functions, we can get guarantees of converging to a _local_
optimum only. However, note that finding the global minimum of an arbitrary
function is _at least NP-hard_.

---
# Stochastic Gradient Descent Convergence

Convex functions mentioned on the previous slide are such that for $→u, →v$
and real $0 ≤ t ≤ 1$,
$$f(t→u + (1-t)→v) ≤ tf(→u) + (1-t)f(→v).$$

![w=88%,mw=50%,h=center](convex_2d.svgz)![w=66.5%,mw=50%,h=center](convex_3d.svgz)

~~~
A twice-differentiable function of a single variable is convex iff its second
derivative is always nonnegative. (For functions of multiple variables,
the Hessian must be positive semi-definite.)

~~~
A local minimum of a convex function is always a global minimum.

~~~
Well-known examples of convex functions are $x^2$, $e^x$, $-\log x$, MSE,
$σ$+NLL, $\softmax$+NLL.

~~~
- $g^{(n)} = 1$
~~~
- For $i = n-1, …, 1$:

~~~
In practice, we do not usually represent networks as collections of scalar
nodes; instead we represent them as collections of tensor functions – most
usually functions $f: ℝ^n → ℝ^m$. Then $\frac{∂f(→x)}{∂→x}$ is a Jacobian
matrix. However, the backpropagation algorithm is analogous.

# Algorithms with Adaptive Learning Rates

AdaGrad has favourable convergence properties (being faster than regular SGD)
for convex loss landscapes. In this settings, gradients converge to zero
reasonably fast.

~~~
However, for nonconvex losses, gradients can stay quite large for a long time.
In that case, the algorithm behaves as if decreasing learning rate by a factor
of $1/\sqrt{t}$, because if each
$$→g ≈ →g_0,$$
then after $t$ steps
$$→r ≈ t ⋅ →g_0^2,$$

~~~
and therefore
$$\frac{α}{\sqrt{→r} + ε} ≈ \frac{α / \sqrt{t}}{\sqrt{→g_0^2} + ε/\sqrt t}.$$

$$(1 - β_1) ∑_{i=1}^t β_1^{t-i} = ∑_{i=1}^t β_1^{t-i} - ∑_{i=0}^{t-1} β_1^{t-i} = 1 - β_1^t,$$

~~~
so we obtain an unbiased estimate by dividing $→s_t$ with $(1 - β_1^t)$, and
analogously for the correction of $→r$.

# Learning Rate Schedules

Even if RMSProp and Adam are adaptive, they still usually require carefully tuned
decreasing learning rate for top-notch performance.

~~~
![w=32%,f=right](decay_linear.svgz)

- **Polynomial decay**: learning rate is multiplied by some polynomial of the
  current update number $t$.
  - **Linear decay** uses $α_t = α_\textrm{initial} ⋅ \big(1 - \frac{t}{\textrm{max~steps}}\big)$ and has
    theoretical guarantees of convergence, but is usually too fast for deep
    neural networks.
~~~
  - **Inverse square root decay** uses $α_t = α_\textrm{initial} ⋅ \frac{1}{\sqrt{t}}$
    and is currently used by best machine translation models.

~~~
![w=32%,f=right](decay_exponential.svgz)

- **Exponential decay**: learning rate is multiplied by a constant each
  minibatch/epoch/several epochs.

  - $α_t = α_\textrm{initial} ⋅ c^t$
  - Often used for convolutional networks (image recognition etc.).

# Learning Rate Schedules

![w=32%,f=right](decay_cosine.svgz)

- **Cosine decay**: The cosine decay has became quite popular in the past years,
  both for training and finetuning.

  $$α_t = α_\textrm{initial} ⋅ \frac{1}{2}\bigg(1 + \cos\Big(π ⋅ \frac{t}{\textrm{max~steps}}\Big)\bigg)$$

~~~
- Cyclic restarts, warmup, …

~~~
The `tf.optimizers.schedules` offers several such learning rate schedules,
which can be passed to any Keras optimizer directly as a learning rate.
- `tf.optimizers.schedules.PiecewiseConstantDecay`
- `tf.optimizers.schedules.PolynomialDecay`
- `tf.optimizers.schedules.ExponentialDecay`
- `tf.optimizers.schedules.CosineDecay`

# Deep Double Descent – Effective Model Complexity

The authors define the **Effective Model Complexity** (**EMC**) of a training procedure $𝓣$ with respect to distribution $𝓓$ and parameter $ε>0$
as
$$\operatorname{EMC}_{𝓓,ε}(𝓣) ≝  \max \big\{n \,\big|\, 𝔼_{⁇S∼𝓓^n}[\mathrm{Error}_S(𝓣(S))] ≤ ε\big\},$$
where $\mathrm{Error}_S(M)$ is the mean error of a model $M$ on the train samples $S$.

~~~
**Hypothesis:** For any natural data distribution $𝓓$, neural-network-based
training procedure $𝓣$, and small $ε>0$, if we consider the task of predicting
labels based on $n$ samples from $𝓓$, then:

- **Under-parametrized regime.** If $\operatorname{EMC}_{𝓓,ε}(𝓣)$ is
  sufficiently smaller than $n$, any perturbation of $𝓣$ that increases its
  effective complexity will decrease the test error.

~~~
- **Over-parametrized regime.** If $\operatorname{EMC}_{𝓓,ε}(𝓣)$ is
  sufficiently larger than $n$, any perturbation of $𝓣$ that increases its
  effective complexity will decrease the test error.

~~~
- **Critically parametrized regime.** If $\operatorname{EMC}_{𝓓,ε}(𝓣) ≈ n$,
  then a perturbation of $𝓣$ that increases its effective complexity might
  decrease **or increase** the test error.
