# Basic RNN Cell

![w=50%,h=center,mh=55%](../06/rnn_cell_basic.pdf)

Given an input $→x^{(t)}$ and previous state $→s^{(t-1)}$, the new state is computed as
$$→s^{(t)} = f(→s^{(t-1)}, →x^{(t)}; →θ).$$

One of the simplest possibilities is
$$→s^{(t)} = \tanh(⇉U→s^{(t-1)} + ⇉V→x^{(t)} + →b).$$

---
# Basic RNN Cell

Basic RNN cells suffer a lot from vanishing/exploding gradients (_the challenge
of long-term dependencies_).

If we simplify the recurrence of states to
$$→s^{(t)} = ⇉U→s^{(t-1)},$$
we get
$$→s^{(t)} = ⇉U^t→s^{(0)}.$$

If $U$ has eigenvalue decomposition of $⇉U = ⇉Q ⇉Λ ⇉Q^{-1}$, we get
$$→s^{(t)} = ⇉Q ⇉Λ^t ⇉Q^{-1} →s^{(0)}.$$
The main problem is that the _same_ function is iteratively applied many times.

Several more complex RNN cell variants have been proposed, which alleviate
this issue to some degree, namely **LSTM** and **GRU**.

---
# Long Short-Term Memory

Later in Gers, Schmidhuber & Cummins (1999) a possibility to _forget_
information from memory cell $→c_t$ was added.

  →h_t & ← →o_t \cdot \tanh(→c_t)

section: GRU
# Gated Recurrent Unit

_Gated recurrent unit (GRU)_ was proposed by Cho et al. (2014) as
a simplification of LSTM. The main differences are
- no memory cell
- forgetting and updating tied together

# Highway Networks

For input $→x$, fully connected layer computes
$$→y ← H(→x, ⇉W_H).$$

~~~

Highway networks add residual connection with gating:
$$→y ← H(→x, ⇉W_H) \cdot T(→x, ⇉W_T) + →x \cdot (1 - T(→x, ⇉W_T)).$$

~~~

Usually, the gating is defined as
$$T(→x, ⇉W_T) ← σ(⇉W_T →x + →b_T).$$

# Regularizing RNNs

## Dropout

- Using dropout on hidden states interferes with long-term dependencies.

~~~

- However, using dropout on the inputs and outputs works well and is used
frequently.
~~~
    - In case residual connections are present, the output dropout needs to be
      applied before adding the residual connection.

~~~
- Several techniques were designed to allow using dropout on hidden states.
    - Variational Dropout
    - Recurrent Dropout
    - Zoneout

# Regularizing RNNs

## Variational Dropout

![w=85%,h=center](variational_rnn.pdf)

~~~
Implemented in `tf.keras.layers.{RNN,LSTM,GRU}` using `dropout` and
`recurrent_dropout` arguments (for dropping inputs and previous states,
respectively).

---
# Regularizing RNNs

## Recurrent Dropout

Dropout only candidate states (i.e., values added to the memory cell in LSTM and previous state in GRU).

~~~
## Zoneout

Randomly preserve hidden activations instead of dropping them.

~~~
## Batch Normalization

Very fragile and sensitive to proper initialization (there were papers with
negative results until people managed to make it work).

---
# Regularizing RNNs

## Layer Normalization

Much more stable than batch normalization.

section: Word Embeddings
# Word Embeddings

One-hot encoding considers all words to be independent of each other.

However, words are not independent – some are more similar than others.

Ideally, we would like some kind of similarity in the space of the word
representations.

~~~
## Distributed Representation
The idea behind distributed representation is that objects can
be represented using a set of common underlying factors.

~~~
We therefore represent words as fixed-size _embeddings_ into $ℝ^d$ space,
with the vector elements playing role of the common underlying factors.

---
# Word Embeddings

The word embedding layer is in fact just a fully connected layer on top of
one-hot encoding. However, it is important that this layer is _shared_ across
the whole network.

Use state after processing the whole sequence (alternatively, take output of the
last element).

# Structured Prediction

Consider generating a sequence of $y_1, \ldots, y_N ∈ Y^N$ given input
$→x_1, \ldots, →x_N$.

~~~
Predicting each sequence element independently models the distribution $P(y_i | ⇉X)$.

~~~
However, there may be dependencies among the $y_i$ themselves, which
is difficult to capture by independent element classification.

---
# Conditional Random Fields

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph such that $Y$ is indexed by vertices of $G$.
Then $(⇉X, →y)$ is a conditional Markov field, if the random variables $→y$
conditioned on $⇉X$ obey the Markov property with respect to the graph, i.e.,
$$P(y_i | ⇉X, y_j, i ≠j) = P(y_i | ⇉X, y_j ~ ∀j: (i, j) ∈ E).$$

~~~
Usually we assume that dependencies of $→y$, conditioned on $⇉X$, form a chain.

---
# Linear-Chain Conditional Random Fields (CRF)

Linear-chain Conditional Random Fields, usually abbreviated only to CRF, acts as
an output layer. It can be considered an extension of a softmax – instead of
a sequence of independent softmaxes, CRF is a sentence-level softmax, with
additional weights for neighboring sequence elements.

~~~
$$s(⇉X, →y; →θ, ⇉A) = ∑_{i=1}^N \big(⇉A_{y_{i-1}, y_i} + f_→θ(y_i | ⇉X)\big)$$

~~~
$$p(→y | ⇉X) = \softmax_{→z ∈ Y^N}\big(s(⇉X, →z)\big)_{→z}$$

~~~
$$\log p(→y | ⇉X) = s(⇉X, →y) - \operatorname{logadd}_{→z ∈ Y^N}(s(⇉X, →z))$$


---
# Linear-Chain Conditional Random Fields (CRF)

## Computation

We can compute $p(→y | ⇉X)$ efficiently using dynamic programming. If we denote
$α_t(k)$ as probability of all sentences with $t$ elements with the last $y$
being $k$.

~~~
The core idea is the following:

![w=40%,h=center](crf_composability.pdf)

$$α_t(k) = f_→θ(y_t=k | ⇉X) + \operatorname{logadd}_{j∈Y} (α_{t-1}(j) + ⇉A_{j, k}).$$

~~~
For efficient implementation, we use the fact that
$$\ln(a+b) = \ln a + \ln (1 + e^{\ln b - \ln a}).$$

# Conditional Random Fields (CRF)

## Decoding

We can perform optimal decoding, by using the same algorithm, only replacing
$\operatorname{logadd}$ with $\max$ and tracking where the maximum was attained.

~~~
## Applications

CRF output layers are useful for _span labeling_ tasks, like
- named entity recognition
- dialog slot filling
