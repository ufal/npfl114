### Assignment: mnist_multiple
#### Date: Deadline: Mar 20, 7:59 a.m.
#### Points: 3 points
#### Tests: mnist_multiple_tests

In this assignment you will implement a model with multiple inputs and outputs.
Start with the [mnist_multiple.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/04/mnist_multiple.py)
template and:
- The goal is to create a model, which given two input MNIST images, compares if the
  digit on the first one is greater than on the second one.
- We perform this this comparison in two different ways:
  - first by directly predicting the comparison by the network (_direct comparison_),
  - then by first classifying the images into digits and then comparing these predictions (_indirect comparison_).
- The model has four outputs:
  - _direct comparison_ whether the first digit is greater than the second one,
  - digit classification for the first image,
  - digit classification for the second image,
  - _indirect comparison_ comparing the digits predicted by the above two outputs.
- You need to implement:
  - the model, using multiple inputs, outputs, losses and metrics;
  - construction of two-image dataset examples using regular MNIST data via the `tf.data` API.
