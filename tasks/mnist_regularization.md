### Assignment: mnist_regularization
#### Date: Deadline: Mar 31, 23:59
#### Points: 6 points

You will learn how to implement three regularization methods in this assignment.
Start with the
[mnist_regularization.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/03/mnist_regularization.py)
template and implement the following:
- Allow using dropout with rate `args.dropout`. Add a dropout layer after the
  first `Flatten` and also after all `Dense` hidden layers (but not after the
  output layer).
- Allow using L2 regularization with weight `args.l2`. Use
  `tf.keras.regularizers.L1L2` as a regularizer for all kernels and biases
  of all `Dense` layers (except the last one).
- Allow using label smoothing with weight `args.label_smoothing`. Instead
  of `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy`, you will need to use
  `CategoricalCrossentropy` which offers `label_smoothing` argument.

In ReCodEx, there will be three tests (one for each regularization methods) and
you will get 2 points for passing each one.

In addition to submitting the task in ReCodEx, also run the following
variations and observe the results in TensorBoard (notably training, development
and test set accuracy and loss):
- dropout rate `0`, `0.3`, `0.5`, `0.6`, `0.8`;
- l2 regularization `0`, `0.001`, `0.0001`, `0.00001`;
- label smoothing `0`, `0.1`, `0.3`, `0.5`.
